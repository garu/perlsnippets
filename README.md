perlsnippets
============

This repository provides a showcase of short Perl/CPAN code snippets
in JSON format. You're welcome to use them in your website!

The main goal of this project is to provide quick samples of Perl code
to show beginners how easy it is to achieve cool things using Perl and
CPAN. It is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but additions and
suggestions are welcome!

The file you want is called perlsnippets.js. Look for it inside the
directory corresponding to your preferred (human) language. If you can't
find your language, please add it! You can use the 'en' folder
as canonical.

Enjoy :)
